# Media Tracker

**NOTE: Very much a work in progress**

## Goals

### Personal Technical Goals

As an individual who has been managing developers for several years with less hands-on coding, I felt the need to get a little hands on.

Large goals:

- **Brush up on React.** This includes writing clean and reusable components, writing unit tests and ensuring my style/CSS skills are still fresh.
- **Learn Python.** I have had exposure to Python and been quite involved in code reviews over the past couple of years, but I want to understand the basics and get comfortable building APIs myself as well. This includes writing endpoints, getting familiar with more advanced concepts and scripts, and writing tests.
- **Bonus: Build this application and host on AWS.** I have experience in AWS Code Suite, but I'd like to take a step back and ensure I have all of the fundamentals down.

### Project Feature Goals

As someone who enjoys consumption of various media, I have always wished there was a single place for my "collection" to live between music, movies, books, games, etc. I want to build a dynamic application that can treat them all as similar entities and allow connections between relevant pieces.

Large goals:

- **Create reasonable models for all media types.** I am going to take this one section by section starting with Music which will include Artists, Albums, Shows/Concerts, Venues and Songs. Along the way, I want to get increasingly comfortable creating API-driven functionality and any necessary business logic.
- **Allow Ranking of media types.** Whether it is just ranking albums of your favorite artist or creating tier lists for various combinations of items (like favorites from 2023 or favorite horror movies), I want to create a foundation that provides flexibility.
- **Import data from public APIs.** As a music fan, I enjoy going to concerts. I track shows I have attended through setlist.fm. However, they do not do a great job at providing a single record for a show with multiple artists. One of the first tasks I set for myself was writing a command to pull shows from their public API and mapping to a streamlined Show model.
- **Give Github Issues a go.** I have years of experience with Jira and some experience with other ticketing platforms (Trello, Microsoft Tasks, ClickUp). But I would like to start pencilling in new features and bugs directly within Github for a change.

## Code

### Backend

I am building the backend out in Python (Django) to get up to speed with the language and get more familiar with hands-on API design and implementation.

### Frontend

I am building the frontend out in React to brush up on my frontend skills and test out some new things.
