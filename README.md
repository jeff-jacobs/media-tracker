# Media Tracker

A pet project to list and track features around types of media: music, games, movies, books and maybe more later. I am using this as an opportunity to solve a need I'd like to see in one place as well as dusting off some frontend skills and build some backend skills.

## Backend

I am building the backend out in Python (Django) to get up to speed with the language and get more familiar with hands-on API design and implementation.

## Frontend

I am building the frontend out in React to brush up on my frontend skills and test out some new things.
